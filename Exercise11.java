    Add a field to the BankAccount class named transactionFee for a real number
    representing an amount of money to deduct every time the user withdraws money.
    The default value is $0.00, but the client can change the value.
    Deduct the transaction fee money during every withdraw call (but not from deposits).
    Make sure that the balance cannot go negative during a withdrawal.
    If the withdrawal (amount plus transaction fee) would cause it to become
    negative, donâ€™t modify the balance at all.
